# Multi-Agent System for Web Automation and Development

A powerful multi-agent system that combines various specialized AI agents to automate web tasks, manage infrastructure, and streamline development workflows using OpenAI's GPT models and/or Open Source Models.

## 🚀 Features

- **Web Automation**: Automated web scraping and search operations
- **Infrastructure Management**: Terraform configuration and AWS CLI automation
- **Development Tools**: Automated setup of development environments
- **Interactive UI**: Web-based interface for easy interaction with agents

## 🛠 Installation

0. **Install NPM to be able to use MCP**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/metantonio/open-first-agent
   cd open-first-agent
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Or use Conda:**

  ```bash
   conda create -n openai-first-agent python=3.10
   conda activate openai-first-agent
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
   

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configurations
   ```


### Running the UI Agents

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Start the Chainlit UI:
```bash
chainlit run ui.py
```

**Experimental Mac UI / Debug mode:**

You will need to install the following library depending if you are in Mac or Windows:

```bash
pip install PyQt6>=6.4.0 # For Mac
pip install tkinter # For Windows
```

```bash
python experimental_ui.py
```

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Required environment variables in your `.env` file:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key (if using Claude)
- Additional keys based on enabled agents (AWS, etc.)

## 🚦 Getting Started`

1. **Access the web interface**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`
   - Select the agent system you want to use
   - Follow the interactive prompts

## 📚 Available Agent Systems

1. **Web Automation**
   - Cigar price comparison
   - DuckDuckGo search automation

2. **Infrastructure Management**
   - Terraform configuration management
   - AWS CLI automation
   - Provide the necessary data and tell to the AI to execute certain command in a EC2 instance.

3. **Development Tools**
   - IDE setup and configuration
   - Environment management
   - Jupyter notebook automation

4. **Code Conversion**
   - Conversion of SAS programming code to Python. Eg.:
  ```sh
   in the output folder I have a file named example_sas.sas I want convert it to python using and put the resulted block of code in a file named example_sas.py
  ```
   - Ask to the AI to use or not certain libraries in the result.

5. **Terminal Mode**
   - Execute a Terminal 

6. **Execute commands in the chat mode**
   - Execute commands in the chat mode using `!`. Eg: `!ls -la` 

## Notes

To let MCP to have access to folders, you must change permission of the targeted folder, Eg: `chmod 777 ./openai_mcp/sample_files`
